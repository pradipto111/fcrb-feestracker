## Manual Reset via API

If you need to reset via command line:

1. First, login to get a token:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@feestrack.com","password":"admin123"}'
```

2. Copy the token from the response

3. Reset the date:
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:4000/system/date \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```

## Automatic Reset

The system date is stored in memory, so it will automatically reset to the actual current date when you restart the backend server.

To restart backend:
```bash
# Stop the backend (Ctrl+C in the backend terminal)
# Then start it again:
cd /Users/pradiptom/fcrb/backend
npm run dev
```

## Note

The system date resets automatically on server restart, so you don't need to manually reset it unless you want to while the server is running.
